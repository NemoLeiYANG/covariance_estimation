# Covariance Estimation Package

*Package Summary* 
This repository is for estimating the covariance of drift suffering proprioceptive sensors, using an exteroceptive sensor with known uncertainty. This package is a generic package, which is capable of estimating the covariance of any proprioceptive sensor (any dimension).
