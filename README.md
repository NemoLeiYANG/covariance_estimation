# covariance_estimation
This repository is for estimating the covariance of drift suffering proprioceptive sensors, using an exteroceptive sensor, with known uncertainty.

The package is a generic package which is capable of estimating the covariance of any proprioceptive sensor (any dimension). This is accomplished using normal equation methods.
