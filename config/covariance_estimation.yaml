# indicate the odometry states that the proprioceptive sensor odometry contain
# for the covariance estimation from [X, Y, Z, ROLL, PITCH, YAW].
# Note that the exteroceptive sensor odometry used in the covariance estimation
# will have to contain the same states in order for the estimation algorithm to work properly.

# size of innovation memory matrix which stores the sigma points innovations
# in order to use them in estimating the proprioceptive sensor scale factor.
# This value is chosen based on the user preference depending on the proprioceptive sensor.
# The more the size of the memory matrix, the more sluggish is the covariance estimation,
# which means it doesnâ€™t change rapidly, and the less the memory matrix, the less sluggish is the
# covariance estimation, which means it changes rapidly with the readings of the sensor.

# covariance confidence factor is a scaling constant which depends on the accuracy of the used

# standard deviation correlation constant correlates the scale factor of the proprioceptive sensor
# to the standard deviation of the proprioceptive sensor deterministic error, which is assumed to
# be random. The choice of this parameter depends on the proprioceptive sensor, which needs the
# estimation and specially on the frequency of the sensor as well as the amount of drift that the
# sensor suffers.
# High drift -> High values
# Low drift -> Low values
# High frequency -> Low values
# Low frequency -> High values
# The choice of the parameter is based on the user preference, which qualitatively assess the
# proprioceptive sensor at hand and based on it tune the value of the standard deviation
# correlation constant.
